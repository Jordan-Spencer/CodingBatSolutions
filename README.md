#CodingBatSolutions
As I work my way through the Java challenges on
CodingBat.com, I'll store my Solutions here. The
goal of each problem will be commented at the top
of each .java file. I'm using Atom and GitBash to
edit and update, so I can better learn them both.

Can't wait to look back on this as the simple days!
